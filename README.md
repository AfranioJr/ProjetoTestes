# Hackday Gympass

<h3>Test automation project as a PoC for front-end test automation implementation on gympass tribes.</h3>

This is a proof o concept of test automation of gympass webpages. The tests are written using cypress.io framework and it'll automate the gympass homepage (that users access to registrate themself/sign-in in the platform). This PoC will also be used as a model to future fron-end automation process from Quality Assurance Engineering team.


### To run this project you will need the bellow tools:
```bash
Git (oh no... are you serious?!)
Node (my current version is v12.6.0)
NPM (my current version is v6.9.0)
Your best code editor (I use VSCode with some extensios)*
```

### To install the project you just need to clone the project and run the bellow commands 

```terminal
$~ npm install
```

### To run tests use npm and aliases configured in package.json. As this project is only a PoC, the only test running npm script need is:
```terminalo
$~ npm run test:chrome
```
Feel free to update anything you miss in here! :)

### My VSCode extensios are:
```bash
Cucumber (Gherkin) full support

Material Icon Theme
```
